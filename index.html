				<h2>The Swimming Sport</h2>

				<h3> </h3>
				<p>  If you were to ask me what my favourite sport is, my answer would be swimming. I started learning how to swim when I was five years old and I have been swimming ever since.

There are many reasons why I love swimming but I‚Äôll just share a few with you, and maybe I can even encourage you to go for a swim.

The first reason that I love swimming is that it can be extremely relaxing. I love the feeling of floating on the water and feeling almost weightless. I find that whenever I leave the pool I feel totally relaxed.

On the other hand, it can also be a fast-paced competitive sport which raises your heartbeat. It‚Äôs amazing pushing yourself to the challenge of beating someone else to the finish line and it‚Äôs great fun racing across the pool as fast as you can! Trying little tricks like underwater handstands and flips also puts a big smile on my face.

Another reason that I love swimming is that it has more variety than other sports. Swimming offers many different strokes, so it doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre stuck doing the same thing over and over again. Adding swimming equipment like flippers, a snorkel or a noodle (a flexible cylindrical piece of foam) changes the experience yet again and can help you develop your swimming technique.

In the summer, swimming provides a nice, refreshing break! There‚Äôs nothing better than jumping into the water on a hot, sweltering summer‚Äôs day. The pool makes you feel instantly better. And I think it adds to the summer holiday feeling, as for me the summer months are when I swim the most. It is a sport which can be done all over the world in many beautiful locations. You can choose to swim in a swimming pool or to go splash in the sea.

And finally, it‚Äôs a life skill which everyone should have. Not only is it good for your health, but you never know when you‚Äôll need your ability to swim <a href="#">Science Proved Medical Advantage of Swimmnig</a>, and if you started it by this time , you'll be a good after a month.</p>

						<p>Located in Krausnick, Germany, the Tropical Islands Resort is the largest indoor water park in the world. The water park is inside a huge building that was originally built as a zeppelin hangar but the airship it was intended to house was never built. A Malaysian company bought the hangar and turned into the Tropical Islands Resort, complete with a rainforest, beach, artificial sun, palm trees and several pools. The largest pool is the 140 meter (460 foot) ‚ÄúTropical Sea‚Äù with an area of 4,400 square meters (47,000 sq ft) designed to look like the waters of a coral island.</p>

						<p>Budapest is famous for its many thermal and medicinal springs. In fact, this city‚Äôs nickname is ‚ÄúCity of Spas.‚Äù Arguably, the most famous of these spas is the Gellert Baths, which was founded almost 100 years ago. Located in the gorgeous Gellert Hotel, the Gellert Baths offer 10 pools that are of varying sizes and temperatures in a stunning Art Nouveau setting. The Gellert Baths feature mosaic tile floors and walls and stained glass windows. In fact, this spa is so beautiful that it is said to be the most photographed in all of Hungary.</p>
